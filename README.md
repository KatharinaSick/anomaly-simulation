# Generic demo service

Purpose of this service is to simulate specific anomaly situations, such as:

- Slowdowns
- Failures
- Increase in resource consumption
- Process crashes
- Calls to one or more other services

Therefore, this generic service can be used to build all kinds of variable demo 
situations with either flat or deep call trees.
